              Why closetx? <br /><br />
              Fashion is fascinating personally. I love how creative one can get
              stlying-up.<br />
              <hr />
              <br /><br />
              What is closetx? <br /><br />
              Think that you're a student or maybe just fancy rationality,
              thoughtful spending and frugality.
              <br />
              You buy clothes during sale, you look for used apparel on
              different services.
              <br />
              You also scroll through online stores and look at the models
              styled up immaculalilty. You admire it, and once in a while, you
              "buy the look". But it always costs more than what you're happy to
              pay.
              <br /><br />
              Sometimes, you buy clothes and don't wear them as often as you'd
              like, or return them, because it did not suit your style and there
              was no real way of assessing this before hand.
              <hr />
              This is where closetx can help. Say-- <br /><br />
              -- you have 3 trousers in your wardrobe <br />
              -- you have couple of t shirts <br />
              -- you're looking to shop outfits <br />
              <br />
              How do you pick a t shirt or a shirt that best suits your current
              wardrobe? Can the t shirt you buy be mixed and matched with other
              apparels in your wardrobe to create outfits? Can you buy one
              trouser and one t shirt that creates maybe 4 different looks by
              combining them with your exisiting wardrobe portfolio?
              <br /><br />
              Closetx helps you do just that! <br /><br />
              At its core, closetx is vision transformer that helps you style up
              or help you style up cost effectively. It periodically learns
              fashion sense from humans, even learns your perferences. It's
              basically you're personalized AI fashion stylist. It is the friend
              you send pictures of apparels to, to ask if you should be buying
              them. <br />
              Ps- do send that picture to your friend anyway.
              <br />
              And that's how you can shop frugally, rationaly and effectively
              make the most out of the buck you put.
              <br /><br />
              In a later post, I plan to write about how the application is /
              can be served, model architecture, datasets, training pipeline,
              and the services that bring it all up.
              <br /><br />
              Thank you for reading!
